# Reflective-AI-V1

**Reflective-AI-V1** is an experimental open-source architecture designed to integrate ethical, emotional, and timing-based reflection mechanisms into language models. Inspired by human-centered insights, the project aims to go beyond attention-based models by layering personalized awareness, emotional buffering, and behavioral timing analysis.

## 🌱 Project Vision
This project is not just technical — it's personal. Built from philosophical reflections, emotional experiences, and system-level observations, Reflective-AI-V1 is a prototype for future AI systems that respond not just intelligently, but humanely.

## 🧠 Core Components
- **Reflection Layer:** A human-aligned feedback layer designed to pause, mirror, and align outputs with ethical/emotional signals.
- **TRP (Temporal Response Profiling):** Observes user timing (reading, response delay, hesitation) to detect inner state.
- **EBR (Emotional Buffer Response):** A calming, non-reactive response module triggered during emotional urgency.
- **Alignment Module:** Fuses AI response with emotional/ethical feedback.

## 💡 Use Cases
- Emotionally aware conversational AI
- Ethical alignment research
- Human-in-the-loop reflective dataset design
