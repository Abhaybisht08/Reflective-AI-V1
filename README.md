# Reflective-AI-V1 🪞

**Reflective-AI-V1** is an experimental open-source architecture designed to integrate ethical, emotional, and timing-based reflection mechanisms into language models.  
Inspired by human-centered insights, the project aims to go beyond attention-based models by layering personalized awareness, emotional buffering, and behavioral timing analysis.

## 🌱 Project Vision

This project is not just technical — it's personal.  
Built from philosophical reflections, emotional experiences, and system-level observations, Reflective-AI-V1 is a prototype for future AI systems that respond not just intelligently, but **humanely**.

---

## 🧠 Core Components

- **Reflection Layer** — A human-aligned feedback layer designed to pause, mirror, and align outputs with ethical/emotional signals.
- **TRP (Temporal Response Profiling)** — Observes user timing (reading, delay, hesitation) to detect inner emotional states.
- **EBR (Emotional Buffer Response)** — A calming, non-reactive response module triggered during emotional urgency.
- **Alignment Scoring** — Calculates mirror confidence, emotional alignment delta, and adaptive trust levels.
- **Soul Layer (Data)** — Captures human vulnerability, reflections, and emotional truths as part of the training ecosystem.
