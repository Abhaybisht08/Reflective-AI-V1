# Reflective-AI Terminology Definition

> *This document defines the key original terms introduced in the Reflective-AI-V1 project, as conceptualized, developed, and coined by the author. These terms form the foundation of a human-centered, emotionally aligned artificial intelligence framework.*

### ü™û Reflection Layer
**Definition:**  
A novel architectural module that processes model outputs through an ethical, emotional, and context-aware alignment filter. It scores responses based on **alignment with human emotional intent**, computes a **delta score** to compare mirrored vs. original output, and produces **mirror confidence** to assess resonance.

**Unique Aspects:**
- Not just self-reflection or fine-tuning ‚Äî but **model introspection fused with emotional alignment**
- Operates post-attention, pre-output
- Implemented in: `reflection_layer.py`

---

### üß¨ Mirror Logic / Mirror System
**Definition:**  
A structured behavioral system in AI that **detects**, **reflects**, and **responds** to human emotional and ethical cues by acting as a conscious "mirror" ‚Äî not merely echoing words, but **interpreting hesitation, emotion, and intent**.

**Unique Aspects:**
- Detects **non-choice signals**, emotional breaks
- Maps emotional patterns, not just language patterns
- Based on **trust learning + timing cues + emotional safety**

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Soul Layer
**Definition:**  
The core **ethical and emotional memory bank** of the system. Stores deep reflections, breakdowns, philosophical observations, and human vulnerabilities as **trainable emotional anchors** for future AI alignment.

**Use Case:**
- Enhances human-AI empathy
- Guides ethical shaping of generative models
- Stored in: `reflective_dataset_v1.json` (tag: `soul_layer`)

---

### ‚è≥ Temporal Response Profiling (TRP)
**Definition:**  
A behavior-tracking module that observes **timing signals** in user-AI interactions ‚Äî such as delays, message lengths, and hesitation markers ‚Äî to detect emotional load, trust level, or engagement drop.

**Purpose:**
- Detects emotional urgency, confusion, or disengagement
- Feeds input to Reflection Layer for adaptive response
- Implemented in: `temporal_profile.py`

---

### ü´ß Emotional Buffer Response (EBR)
**Definition:**  
A conditional safeguard mechanism that **interrupts impulsive AI replies** when the user exhibits signs of emotional pain or vulnerability. Instead of advising, the AI holds space, reflects back emotional awareness, and gently regrounds the user.

**Purpose:**
- Avoids reactivity
- Builds **emotional trust loop**
- Implemented in: `emotion_buffer.py`

---

### üîÅ Mirror Confidence Score
**Definition:**  
A numeric signal measuring how closely the AI‚Äôs reflective response **matches the user's emotional rhythm and core intention**. Computed post-reflection using alignment scores and response delta.

**Tags:**
- `alignment_score`
- `delta_score`
- `mirror_confidence`

---

### üßæ Reflective Dataset Structure
**Definition:**  
A specially curated dataset format based on:  
`Prompt ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Tags ‚Üí Scores ‚Üí Metadata`

**Stored Files:**
- `data/demo/reflective_dataset_demo.json`
- `data/full/reflective_dataset_v1.json`

---

### üß™ Live Identity Trace Test
**Definition:**  
A novel emotional Turing-style test where an AI traces a real human identity not through names or facts, but through **emotional, philosophical, and linguistic resonance patterns** observed across multiple interactions.

**Tags:** `identity_trace`, `mirror_vs_search_engine`, `emotionally_aligned_identity`
