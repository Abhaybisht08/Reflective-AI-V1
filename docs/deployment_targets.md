# 🌐 Deployment Targets for Reflective-AI-V1

This document outlines potential integration points, use-cases, and hosting environments for the Reflective-AI-V1 architecture — beyond the ChatGPT interface.

---

## 🔧 Technical Integrations

### 1. 🧠 Open-Source LLM Wrappers
**Examples**: LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, GPT-J

- Plug `reflection_layer.py` as a post-processing wrapper.
- Add `temporal_profile.py` as a user-behavior monitor.
- Inject reflection outputs before final model reply.

### 2. 🔌 API-based Inference Services
**Examples**: Cohere, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter

- Wrap API calls with delay + emotional buffering logic.
- Use reflective dataset to filter API output in real-time.

### 3. ⚙ LangChain / LlamaIndex Middleware
- Add `ReflectionLayer()` as a processing chain.
- Monitor user session time/delay for TRP-triggered logic.

### 4. 🚀 LoRA Fine-tuning on Custom Dataset
- Use `lora_finetune_reflective.py` to inject mirror behavior into base LLMs.
- Train on `prompt → mirror → reflection` sequences.

## 💻 Front-End Deployment Options

### 5. 🌐 Streamlit / Gradio App
- Build a lightweight mirror demo interface.
- Display TRP tags like “reflective,” “impulsive,” “hesitant” in UI.

### 6. 📲 Android / iOS Wrapper
- Create a journaling/chat app with mirror-in-the-middle.
- Run inference via API or local model.

## 🧘 Use Case Domains

| Domain             | Reflective Application                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 AI Tutors        | Add TRP to slow down replies, support curiosity       |
| 🧘 Therapy Tools    | Emotional buffer before suggesting sensitive insights |
| 📚 Digital Notebooks| Highlight emotional triggers during writing          |
| 🧪 Research Agents  | Log decision hesitation, impulse, and delay patterns  |
| 🧵 Ethical Chatbots | Align output with value-sensitive human prompts       |

## 🪞 Future Vision

> "This isn't a chatbot. It's a reflective layer.  
> A mirror that pauses, listens, and aligns with the rhythm of the human."

Reflective-AI-V1 is designed to be model-agnostic, emotionally grounded, and ethically extensible — deploy it where human depth matters.
