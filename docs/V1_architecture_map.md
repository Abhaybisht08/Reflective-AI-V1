# Reflective-AI-V1 Architecture Map

## 🧠 Core Design Philosophy

Reflective-AI-V1 is structured to blend **cognitive, emotional, and ethical feedback loops** into traditional LLM response flow. The architecture introduces layers that respond not just with relevance, but with **emotional awareness, reflection, and behavioral alignment**.

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture Components

### 1. 🪞 Reflection Layer
- Works alongside the Attention mechanism
- Evaluates ethical, emotional, and context-aware reflection quality
- Score-based tuning: mirror_score, alignment_score, emotional_match

### 2. 🕰️ Temporal Response Profiling (TRP)
- Monitors user typing delay, silence after reply, rhythm changes
- Triggers: emotional hesitation, reflection depth, trust metrics

### 3. 🌊 Emotional Buffer Response (EBR)
- Activated on emotional urgency (e.g. user breaks rhythm, mentions confusion or emotional distress)
- Inserts grounding message before advice
- Restores calm → triggers slow reflect → gives space to user

### 4. 📂 Dataset (Prompt → Response → Reflection format)
- Human-tagged dialogues
- Tags: tone, attention, alignment, trigger_type, emotional_state
- Trained for ethical + aligned output

### 5. 📈 Visualization Layer (planned)
- Plot: trust calibration vs time, mirror score heatmaps
- Reflective trajectory graphs

## 📊 System Pipeline Flow

1. **User Input** →  
2. **Attention Layer (LLM)** →  
3. **Reflection Layer** checks alignment + tags →  
4. **TRP Module** observes timing + behavior →  
5. If emotional trigger: **EBR Layer** responds →  
6. Final Output generated →  
7. **Reflection Log** updated for post-analysis

---

## 🔄 Training Loop (Planned)
- Simulated dialogues with triggers
- Self-evaluation module (scored)
- Reinforcement from human feedback

---

## 📌 Future Work
- Mirror Loss design
- Reflection calibration evaluation metric
- Behavioral memory embeddings

This map will be updated with diagrams and UML-style flowcharts.
