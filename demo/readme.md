# 🪞 Reflective-AI Demo

This folder contains a Colab-ready notebook demonstrating the behavior of the Reflective-AI system.

## 🔍 File

- **Reflective_AI_Demo.ipynb**  
  Run this notebook to simulate the reflective pipeline on a sample prompt.

## 🎯 What It Demonstrates

- Prompt interpretation by the base model (raw response)
- Mirror Layer enhancement with emotionally aligned output
- Triggering of Emotional Buffer Response (if high emotional load is detected)
- Hesitation profiling using TRP (Temporal Response Profiling)
- Reflection scoring:
  - Alignment Score
  - Delta (change from raw to mirror)
  - Mirror Confidence

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No installation needed if run on Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Enter your custom prompt
3. Observe reflective processing and scores

🧠 The demo is powered by mock logic from `code/` folder, and designed to represent how the reflective system behaves under different emotional and semantic inputs.
