End-to-end pipeline to:
- Load a prompt
- Run base model
- Apply Reflection Layer
- Compute alignment scores
- Log output + visualize triggers

This becomes your showcase + public demo core.

Demo Logic â€“ Reflective AI Evaluation Loop

For each input prompt:
    1. Generate base LLM response (no reflection)
    2. Inject Reflection Layer (simulated or light-trained)
    3. Compare:
       - Emotional tone change
       - Use of mirror prompts
       - Trigger detection accuracy
       - Mirror Confidence (alignment score)

Goal: Evaluate the impact of reflection injection on response quality.
